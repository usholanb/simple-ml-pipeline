# models is dict, first comes unique tag and then the name of the model
# all outside library models are named based on their class name
# transformed into snake case
# Example: sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression -> linear_regression
# These models are applied on <dataset.input_path> and their predictions are
# saved for model comparison
